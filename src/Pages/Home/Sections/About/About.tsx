                I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Cidade de SÃ£o Paulo (UNICID),
                 where I took some tests and my evaluations were very good.
                I know I'm starting my studies, but I study every day, but not only at my university,
                 I have used some platforms like Microsoft Learn, Youtube, Google, Udemy among others.
                I have studied a little about SCRUM agile methodologies where I have certification.
